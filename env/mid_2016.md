#### Dev environment as of Mid 2016

**Machine**
- MacBook Air: OSX Yosemite

    - Though I am on MacBook Air I use linux as development box using virtualization solutions.


**Terminal**
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

    - Better than default Mac OSX terminal.


**Virtualization**
- [xHyve](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve)

    - I have installed Ubuntu server 16.04 as development OS on xHyve.
    - Though xHyve supports direct login into OS, I like to ssh the running machine.
    - You can install multiple OS images with xHyve but I would rather use container solution.


**Container**
- [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/)

    - For testing my code on multiple OS I have lxd installed on Ubuntu server 16.04.
    - Lxd supports custom OS images as well.


**Shell**
- [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/)

    - Good autocomplete.
    - Easy to extend.


**Terminal Multiplexer**
- [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/)

    - Fast with client/server model.
    - I use it with vi key bindings.


**Editor**
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

    - Its Vi/Vim fork ;)
    - List of [plugins](https://github.com/pratz/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/init.vim) I use.


**Code Searching**
- [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)

    - Searches faster than grep.
    - Can be integrated with vi/vim/nvim.


**File Searching**
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

    - Faster than defualt file search tools.
    - Can be integrated with vi/vim/nvim.
